# Frontend Development

## Setup

1. Clone this repo
2. Setup a local instance of Home Assistant, I prefer to use Docker for this
3. Install the [Bambu Lab Integration](https://github.com/greghesp/ha-bambulab)
4. Setup a docker-compose.yml file with the correct volume binds. My file as an example:

```yml
version: "3.3"
services:
  hass:
    image: homeassistant/home-assistant:beta
    container_name: homeassistant
    restart: unless-stopped # To reboot the container when the host comes back up from restarts.
    ports:
      - 8123:8123
    volumes:
      - type: bind
        source: ../this_repo/custom_components/bambu_lab # Path to this folder within this repo
        target: /config/www/community/ha-bambulab-cards
      - ./hass_dev:/config
```

## Development

1. Navigate to the frontend directory
2. `npm install` to install dependecies
3. `npm start` to start the development server
3. If your work is complete, run `npm build` to generate the `dist/ha-bambulab-cards.js` before committing
